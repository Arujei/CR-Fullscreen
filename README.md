CR-Fullscreen
=============

Crunchyroll Fullscreen app and sleep/shutdown timer.

Version Notes
=============
Version: 2.0 (Release: 28 March 2014)
Notes:
2.0
Replace looping with a timer.
Replaced pausing the script with stopping and starting the timer.
Added Sleep timer of intervals between 5-300 mins.
(Simply uses spacebar to pause video after timer expires.)
Added Shutdown timer similar to sleep timer, but shuts PC off in 60 seconds. 
- Note: uses forced shutdown. "shutdown -f -s -t 60"
Added more notes for those interested on what I am doing.
1.0
Simple loop script window using image detection.

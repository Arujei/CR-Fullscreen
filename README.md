CR-Fullscreen
=============

Crunchyroll Fullscreen app and sleep/shutdown timer.

Version Notes
=============
Version: 2.1 (Release: 28 August 2014)
Notes:
2.1
Fixed the issue where it will click itself out of fullscreen in chrome.
Added scroll down between failures of not finding the button to scroll the screen down for those smaller screens as a quick fix.
Reduced area of detection to just the Crunchyroll browser window.
2.0
Replace looping with a timer.
Replaced pausing the script with stopping and starting the timer.
Added Sleep timer of intervals between 5-300 mins.
(Simply uses spacebar to pause video after timer expires.)
Added Shutdown timer similar to sleep timer, but shuts PC off in 60 seconds. 
- Note: uses forced shutdown. "shutdown -f -s -t 60"
Added more notes for those interested on what I am doing.
1.0
Simple loop script window using image detection.
